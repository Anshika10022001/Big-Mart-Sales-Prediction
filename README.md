# Big Mart Sales Prediction

A Machine Learning Project in python for prediction of sales of various products at various stores using Linear Regression Model.

### Overview
 
- The data scientists at BIG MART have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities.

- Furthermore, certain attributes of each products and store have been defined.

- The aim of this project is to build a predictive model and find the sales figure of each product..

## Analysis Framework

- Data Gathering: Collected the releveant data from SimpliLearn Course Resources into the MS Excel
- Data Cleaning: The process included removal of null values, removal of noise values and removal of unnecesssary columns
- Data Preprocessing: This process included outlier removal, label encoding, splitting the data into training and testing and standardization
- Developed a linear regression machine learning model in Python to predict sales figures for different products at various stores
- Used historical sales data and other relevant features, such as store location, product type, and time of year, to train the model
- Used the trained model to make sales predictions for each product at each store in the future
- Visualized the predicted sales figures using charts and graphs to facilitate interpretation and decision-making by stakeholders

## Visualizations
- The following chart depicts the sales predicted in each outlet number
- As shown below the highest sales are predicted in Outlet Number 5

## Lessons Learned

- Always plan ahead: Planning ahead and creating a roadmap of the different activities that need to be completed can help keep the project on track and ensure that all the necessary steps are completed in a timely and efficient manner.

- Data cleaning is essential: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis is a critical step in any data project, as it ensures that the insights are based on accurate and reliable data.

- The importance of visualization: Creating visualizations of the data can help communicate insights to stakeholders and make them more engaging and understandable.

- The power of automation: Using tools and scripts to automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks can save a significant amount of time and effort, allowing more focus on the actual analysis and insights.

- Continuous learning: Technology and tools are constantly evolving, and keeping up to date with the latest developments can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future projects.

## Tech Stack

**Python:** Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Data Preprocessing, Outlier Removal, Encoding, Scaling, Linear Regression Model

## Future Scope

- Actionable recommendations: Based on the insights generated from the dashboard, the project can provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders. For example, BIG MART will try to understand the properties of products and stores, which play a key role in increasing sales.
